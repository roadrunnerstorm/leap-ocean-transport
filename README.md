# LEAP Project: Air-Sea Interactions
The air-sea interface, where the Earth's atmosphere meets the ocean, is very dynamic and critical for the coupled climate
system. This interface plays a central role in regulating long term climate, shaping weather, and maintaining marine
ecosystems through the exchange of heat, momentum and gases. These exchanges are a result of an intricate and coupled
interplay between oceanic and atmospheric flows, and significant variability across scales in these flows poses a challenge for
accurate modeling of these exchanges. Using high resolution atmosphere-ocean coupled models, research over the last two
decades has highlighted the significance of heterogeneity in the air-sea exchange, and the impact this has on the boundary
layers, surface flows, winds, clouds and rainfall.
As part of this effort, summer students will work on analyzing the small scale hetrogeneity that emerges in these
simulations, and use machine learning methods (like symbolic regression) to find links and derive functional relationship
between the impacts of this heterogeneity on the large scale atmosphere-ocean exchange and the large scale flow features
in the atmosphere and ocean. These projects aim to teach students about important processes in air-sea exchange and
climate science, and help them develop physical intuition and data-driven models for these processes.
